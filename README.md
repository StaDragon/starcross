A two player game developed for Kiwijam 2022. Play here: [Itch.io link]

Goal:
Sticking together to get the highest score possible while dodging obstacles coming your way. If you get hit by an obstacle, you both split. Getting hit again while both of you are separate will remove lives. Once all lives are removed, the game is over.
